The way to minimize harm is through economic incentives.

The expected cost of doing harm must be greater than the expected benefit in order to deter bad actors.

Coercion is the ability to gain compliance with a credible threat of significant harm.

The only ethical use of coercion is to prevent or acquire restitution for harm.

The idea is that most harm is prevented by credible threat of coercion rather than the use of coercion but it won't be credible unless the actor is willing and able to use it.

Harm is subjective.

Millions of people have determined that they are significantly harmed if anyone publishes a cartoon of their prophet.

What is to prevent someone from claiming infinite harm if they don't get compliance?

What is the true indifference value on compensation in event of harm?

That value happens to be logically identical to the payout on an insurance policy taken out against the harm.

For all harms worth preventing, an insurance policy (or multiple) should be purchased that pays out if the harm occurs.

If the harm occurs (and it is not self-inflicted), the insurance company will pay out the victim then recover costs from the party responsible (fine, sue, confiscate property, kidnap and hold for ransom or indentured servitude, kill and sell organs(?!), write it off as a loss if too costly to get restitution, etc.)

Government does this already to some extent, but never pays out the victim, keeping all restitution for itself.

Insurance companies + security companies + private mediators/arbitrators + private detectives + ...  = government competition, especially if/when they are successful enough to support a charity that pays for insurance for people that can't afford it

The prediction is that insurance companies will discover that they can reduce costs (enabling cheaper premiums and more demand) by actively reducing harm claims and going through private channels to recover restitution (rather than relying on the public justice system).

For all government roles, if it in fact necessary you can imagine it being on the payroll of an Assurance Co

Yes, to the extent that people have unearned money to spend on themselves, the system will be unfair. The best way to correct for that, however, is to get them to part with their unearned money through voluntary trade. After all, the money is of no value until it is traded.

Axiocracy requires new morals.

* You can't be repulsed by the idea that some people lives are literally more valuable than others (as judged by summing over subjective values)
* You can't be repulsed by the idea that richer people have more options and actually deserve the credit if they acquired their wealth honestly.
* Property (negative) rights take precedence over all positive rights.
* Taxation is literally extortion.
* Coercion is only ethical when used to avoid or compensate for harm.
* Harm is quantified in insurance policy payouts.


```
A: A life is worth exactly as much as it is insured for.
B: What if someone can't afford life insurance?
A: No one is required to pay for their own life insurance.
B: Who's going to pay for someone else's insurance?
A: Take your example.
B: What do you mean?
A: What if someone can't afford life insurance?
B: That would be terrible! There would be no cost to killing them!
A: Why is that bad if there is no harm done?
B: Of course there's harm done! Someone was killed. Poor people have rights too!
A: True they have a right to be compensated for harm done, but what harm was done if their life was insured for $0?
B: Surely it was worth more than that.
A: Maybe but value is subjective. How much is their life worth to you?
B: To me? Who?
A: The poor person.
B: Some random poor person that gets killed?
A: Yes.
B: I don't know. How should I know? We're talking about a hypothetical stranger.
A: So... nothing?
B: Wait. What?
A: You place no value on their life?
B: I didn't say that. Everyone has some value, right?
A: How much? How much would personally contribute to their life insurance?
B: That's not fair, I can't pay for everyone's life insurance!
A: You don't have to. Contribute to a charity that does. Almost no one wants to see anyone die just because they're poor. Together you can raise enough funds so that all poor people have basic insurance. The more generous you are, the better the insurance.
B: Don't I pay taxes for that?
A: Yes, government can be viewed as a primitive, non-voluntary, inefficient version of the same idea.
B: Primitive how?
A: Most obviously the government never pays out when harm is done. Any restitution they recover they keep for themselves.
B: Non-voluntary?
A: The government is the only Assurance Organization that can dictate premiums and policies. 
B: Less efficient?
A: Since a private assurance org isn't allowed to tax it is accountable to its supporters.
B: But the government isn't going to allow competition.
A: Let's wait and see what the people demand.
