Imagine a DAO where anyone can register as an individual or an organization. 
The difference between an individual and an organization doesn't matter for 
our purposes here so let's call them all agents for simplicity. Some agents 
will register to receive UBI (charities) and some will register to donate (patrons). 
A charity will publish claims to the blockchain. One possible set of claims might 
be that the charity is a family of 5 living in northern Ontario with a household 
income of < $20000/year (for example). Donors can create pools by searching for claims. 
One possible pool is all charities that are Canadian families with household incomes < $25000/year. 
This pool would contain the first example of course because it meets the criteria. 

Every month patrons can donate part of their income to any number of pools however 
they choose, and at the end of the month all proceeds are automatically divided to 
all pool participants equitably by smart contracts. All transfers are done with 
crypto-currencies like bitcoin on the blockchain so it is fully transparent and accountable. 

Now this obvious question is how to prevent scammers from pretending to be charities 
in order to take advantage of charitable patrons? This is where another kind of agent 
comes in, authorities. The purpose of authorities is to verify claims. An authority 
will investigate a claim and sign it cryptographically if it finds it to be true. 
For example the Canadian government can verify the claim that the family of 5 mentioned 
above are in fact Canadian citizens that live in northern Ontario. Another charity, 
acting an authority, can verify that the family consists of a single mother and 4 children 
under the age of 14. Patrons can select which authorities they trust when they define 
the search criteria for their pools.

I am calling this DAO CherUBIm. Feedback welcome.
